# Online-Currency-Convertor-System
This project is currently under development. It makes use of the Tkinter GUI library and, the Requests(HTTP-support) library of Python. It is accessible via the use of a valid API key and converts the currencies according to the latest exchange rates. I am extremely grateful to exchangerate-api.com for providing me the access to the latest conversion rates in their surver.
In order to use this application, you should be registed to the website https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ with a valid API key. I have removed my own key from the source code due to security purposes. Upon getting your own key, rewrite the variable which stores the key, and run the program according to your needs.
This program makes an extensive use of the Tkinter and Requests Library, so make sure you have both of them installed in your IDE or any text-editor which is used by you.
Lastly, if you have any suggestion regarding the betterment of this project, pls do reach out to me.
Have fun.. :)
